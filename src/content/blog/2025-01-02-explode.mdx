With the release of this website, this is the seventh iteration of my personal website! This marks deviation from past iterations of my website, everything is **LARGE**.

> I will preface the this text by saying I am not good at talking about myself at length, and prefer to show my ability through my actions (a core focus of this text). Therefore, bear with me through this ðŸ˜…

When thinking about how I wanted to move forward with my brand, I thought it was high time to evaluate how I wanted to present myself to the world. I was a *"Teen Fullstack Web Developer and Software Engineer"* for the longest time, and this identity did me wonders. I worked at [Deel](/resume#deel) and [Replit](/resume#replit) in my junior and senior years of high school, became well-known in some programming circles, and started new computer science initiatives in my local community â€“Â before stepping foot in college!

As I grow into an adult, however, I don't want my experiences from my past to define me. I want my background and talent to be recognized for what it is, and not diminished
by my youth. I want to be given complex tasks and prove that I can solve them. And I wanted my new identity to reflect that I've outgrown my former self into maturity.

When thinking about how I want to present myself to the world going forward, I chose two of my guiding tenets.

1. **I am a software engineer**. Given a problem, I create solutions; given chaos, I craft order. I build bridges between ideas and reality.
2. **I am a technological humanist**. I want to help people, and I believe that can be done through ethical and equitable technology. I want to ensure that technology serves not just efficiency, but empathy.

These traits exemplify my standing philosophy, highlighting the potential I see in humanity and the hope that I can solve some of our problems through my talents.

An odd effect of going to college is that I've felt like there are more opportunities for me to blossom as someone who isn't just making in my field but driving innovation and excellence. I enjoy opportunities to lead, mentor, and guide my peers. My background and knowledge offer interesting perspectives in many situations.

Reflecting on the journey that led me here, I realize how much my understanding of technology and its potential has evolved. In high school, I was driven by the sheer joy of creating â€” solving problems, building systems, and learning at an almost limitless pace. Those formative experiences taught me the importance of curiosity, resilience, and an iterative mindset. But now, as a college student and an emerging professional, I find myself looking beyond just creation.

I want to ensure the work I do has depth, impact, and a meaningful connection to the people and communities it touches. Technology is not just a tool for efficiency or convenience; it is a force that shapes lives, cultures, and futures. With every decision I make as a software engineer, I ask myself: Who does this serve? Whose voices are amplified? Whose are left behind? These questions push me to think critically about the balance between innovation and ethics, speed and sustainability, ambition and responsibility.

This website reflects that shift in mindset. The brutalism is a departure from the minimalism of past iterations. Itâ€™s meant to symbolize confidence â€” not just in what Iâ€™ve done, but in who I am becoming. Itâ€™s a space where I can showcase my projects, my thoughts, and the direction Iâ€™m heading, unapologetically and authentically.

If thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™ve learned in my journey so far, itâ€™s that growth isnâ€™t linear, and the best opportunities often come from unexpected places. With this new chapter, Iâ€™m embracing that uncertainty. Iâ€™m excited to continue learning, building, and contributing, while staying grounded in the principles that matter most to me.

Thank you for visiting my website and for taking the time to read this. Iâ€™m looking forward to what the future holds â€” and to sharing that journey with you here ^_^
